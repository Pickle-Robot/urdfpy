"""Compose the wheel version for Pickle's fork of urdfpy.

This module is only used at build time. Hatchling executes it (see
``[tool.hatch.version]`` in ``pyproject.toml``) and evaluates
:func:`get_version` for the wheel version. It is not shipped in the wheel;
installed code reads its version from package metadata instead (see
``urdfpy/version.py``).

The version is upstream's release plus a PEP 440 local segment::

    0.0.22+pickle.<N>[.<branch>]

``pickle``
    Marks the wheel as Pickle's fork so it is distinguishable from PyPI's
    ``urdfpy 0.0.22`` in filenames, pip output and Artifact Registry
    listings. A local segment also makes the wheel unpublishable to PyPI.

``<N>``
    Monotonic release counter from the ``URDFPY_PICKLE_RELEASE`` environment
    variable. The release workflow sets it to its GitHub run number, which
    only ever increases, so every publish is a distinct, correctly ordered
    version and ``urdfpy==<exact>`` pins one publish. Local builds default
    to ``0`` so any published wheel sorts above them. Mirrors the
    ``+pickle.N`` convention used by nvblox, curobo and punq.

``<branch>``
    Present only for wheels not built from ``master``, so a developer can
    publish a branch wheel for testing without it being mistaken for (or
    ordered against) a mainline release. Taken from ``URDFPY_PICKLE_BRANCH``
    when set, otherwise from ``.git/HEAD`` (detached HEAD gives no segment).
    PEP 440 local segments allow only ``[a-z0-9]`` separated by dots, so the
    branch name is lower-cased and every run of other characters becomes a
    dot.
